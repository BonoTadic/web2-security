    <h1>Choose a vulnerability demonstration</h1>

    <div>
        <h2><a href="/sql-injection">SQL Injection Demonstration</a></h2>
        <p>Demonstrates the SQL Injection vulnerability. The vulnerability can be exploited by checking the
            "Enable SQL Injection Vulnerability" checkbox and entering <b>' OR '1'='1</b> as the User Name. This gives
            the attacker access to the content of the database.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2><a href="/csrf">CSRF Demonstration</a></h2>
        <p>Demonstrates the CSRF vulnerability. Due to the fact that session cookies are automatically included in HTTP
            requests, the vulnerability is enabled by default. When the user navigates to the <b>Account Security</b> page, a
            malicious script is executed that deletes the user's account. Since the session cookie is included in the
            request, the vulnerable website believes that this is a legitimate request. The vulnerability can be prevented
        with the use of a CSRF token. This token is a secret value that is generated by the server and shared with
        the client. When issuing a request to perform a sensitive action, the client must include the correct token.
        Otherwise, the server will refuse to perform the requested action.</p>
